## 1. Information Collection and Use
**Local Data Storage:** The Service operates primarily as an offline application. Game progress, high scores, settings, and in-game currency are stored locally on your device using native storage mechanisms (such as Shared Preferences on Android). We do not transmit this data to our own servers.

**Non-Personal Data:** We may collect non-personal identification information about users whenever they interact with our Service. This may include the type of device, operating system version, and other technical information.

## 2. Third-Party Services and Advertising
We may use third-party services to display advertisements or analyze usage to improve our Service. These third-party service providers may collect information used to identify your device (such as Advertising ID).

## 3. GDPR Compliance (European Union)
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. Since we do not store your personal data on our servers, you have full control over your data locally on your device.

## 4. CCPA Compliance (US - California)
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have the right to request access to and deletion of their personal data.

You can manage your local data by clearing the app's data in your device settings.

## 5. Children’s Privacy (COPPA)
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.

## 6. Security
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
