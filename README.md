# Privacy Policy for Blue Memory Game

**Last updated:** December 14, 2025

Radek Bartoníček built the "Blue Memory Game" app as an Ad Supported app. This SERVICE is provided by Radek Bartoníček at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device (stored locally using native preferences) and is not collected by me on any external server in any way.

The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you (e.g., Advertising ID).

* [AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en)
* [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## GDPR Compliance (European Union)
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. Since I do not store your personal data on my servers (all game progress and currency are stored locally on your device), you have full control over your data.

Regarding third-party ads, I ensure that advertising partners (like Google AdMob) comply with GDPR. When launching the app, you may be presented with a consent form to accept or decline personalized advertising.

## CCPA Compliance (US - California)
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have the right to request access to and deletion of their personal data. As I do not sell your personal data and do not store it on servers, requirements regarding the sale of data do not apply in the traditional sense. You can manage your local data by clearing the app's storage in your device settings.

## Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

## Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Children’s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
